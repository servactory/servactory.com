Added support for extended mode for the `action_shortcuts` option.

```ruby
configuration do
  action_shortcuts(
    {
      restrict: {             # replacement for make
        prefix: :create,      # method name prefix
        suffix: :restriction  # method name suffix
      }
    }
  )
end
```

```ruby
class PaymentsService::Restrictions::Create < ApplicationService::Base
  input :payment, type: Payment

  # The exclamation mark will be moved to the end of the method name
  restrict :payment!

  private

  def create_payment_restriction!
    inputs.payment.restrictions.create!(
      reason: "Suspicion of fraud"
    )
  end
end
```
