# Release 2.6

The following changes have been prepared and implemented.

## Attributes

### Options

#### Changed `consists_of`

The `consists_of` option has become a [dynamic option](../guide/options/dynamic#consists-of-option).

#### Changed `service_class_name`

The `service_class_name` attribute, which is available in some options, has been replaced with a new `service` attribute.

The new attribute is an object containing a prepared data set: `class_name`.

As well as a method for translation: `translate`.

## Configuration

### Added `i18n_root_key`

Added the `i18n_root_key` configuration for renaming the root translation key.
The default value is `servactory`.

```ruby [app/services/application_service/base.rb]
configuration do
  i18n_root_key :datory
end
```
